# H-1B_visa_Enigma
## Please find summary in exploration.md
### There are two parts of code in the repo

- *.ipynb are ipython notebooks with analysis and code

- *.py are python code for organizing functions

I spend around four hours for the above works. This is my first-time dive into H-1B Visa data. There are so many interesting questions can be asked but data itself is not as clean as I thought. Therefore, I spend 1/3 of time figuring out what is the right format for analysis.

My analysis can be divided into three parts:

1. Basic statistic based on section 1.
2. Questions about the data (with figures and code).
3. Predictive model on multiclassification.
